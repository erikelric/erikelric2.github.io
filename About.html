<p>Born and raised in Mexico, I started to develop interest for the fine arts at a very young age, particularly in drawing. Through high school, I would find myself constantly learning about drawing techniques and practices to develop my skills. Yet, at the time of graduating I took a different path for my professional career since, at the time, I was persuaded that I would not have a bright future as an artist. Ranging from engineering to architecture, at the age of 18, I decided to abandon those studies and focus on what I really wanted to do - art. I moved to Texas and began my new degree in fine arts. It was a great pleasure to be in that program, but I felt that I was not yet in the right place. This is where I made the decision to move to California to pursue a more technical role which turned out to be digital media art.</p>

<p>My focus in the digital media has always been character creation. I am constantly sketching and thinking about characters to create and to develop in stories. I started to specialize in this aspect thanks to the influence of videogames and movies such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, The Witcher, Lord Of The Rings, and many others. Thus, for the first time I can say that I am in the right place to be. Now, in my first year as a transfer student, I am currently exploring new areas such as augment reality (AR) and animation as my main goal is to be in the videogame industry. I still have a lot to learn, but I am always open to improve.</p>
